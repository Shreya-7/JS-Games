Made by using [AudioSynth](https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth) by Keith Horwood

Inspired by [this keyboard implementation](https://github.com/1000mileworld/Piano-Keyboard)   
Play/Demo [here](https://shreya-7.github.io/JS-Games/piano/index.html)

**Changes made from the original implementation:**

- Different and easier keyCode lookup implementation
- Event handling
- Compact style application
- ES6 compliant
- Cleaner functions
- General code cleanup
- Minor visual changes (namely rainbow keys)

**TODOS**:

[] add flat notes  
[] style changes  
[] use synth.play instead of .generate  
[] on-screen transcriptions of played notes  
[] add error checks  
[] make labels unselectable  
[] change the key assignments  
[] drag and play
