Inspired by [this implementation](https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game)

**Changes made from the original implementation:**

- Dynamic HTML generation
- Grouping up functions
- Different images
- Comments

**TODOS**:

[] point counter - with negative points
[] status messages  
[] more animations
